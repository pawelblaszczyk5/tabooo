## Description

This is my first bigger project using Svelte and it was so much fun doing it. During development I used Heroku to automatically build and deploy my app as I was pushing to this repo. The game is pretty simple, connect with friends or random people and try to describe the word without using specified forbidden words, which would make it too easy. Cards are available in two languages - English and Polish, you can choose whichever you want during lobby creation. Good luck and have fun!
